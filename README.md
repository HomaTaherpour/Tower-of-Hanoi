# Tower of Hanoi

This project consists of two parts: a text-based Tower of Hanoi solver and a graphical representation using Pygame.

## Text-Based Tower of Hanoi Solver

This part of the project utilizes a recursive function to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem and provides a textual representation of the moves made. It prompts the user for the number of disks, performs the necessary calculations, and prints the sequence of moves to solve the puzzle.

## Graphical Tower of Hanoi 

The graphical representation of the Tower of Hanoi problem is created using the Pygame library. It visually demonstrates the movement of disks between towers, with a count of moves displayed on the screen.
